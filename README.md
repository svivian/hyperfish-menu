Hyperfish - a usable pure CSS menu
=============================

An pure CSS dropdown menu taking advantage of CSS3 transitions to provide a usable experience.


## Installation

1. Rename `yourproject.scss` to whatever suits.
2. In the top section of the file, set any variables from `_hyperfish.scss` that you wish to override. For example, if your menu has 7 items, set:

        $hf-items: 7;

3. To style the menu, override the placeholder selectors in the second section.
4. At the bottom, write your own styles for your site or import another CSS/SCSS file.
